<h1>Olympic Games Analysis SQL Project</h1>

 </h2>

<h2>Description</h2>
We have a dataset containing Information about The Olympic Games
Particularly the 2014 Winter Olympics and 2016 Summer Olympics.
We will treat the games as a whole for our analysis and analyze and query the database across athlete ,events and country level to uncover patterns and key insights.
We will also try to see trends in performance of countries as a group rather than Individual performance to see whether external factors such as population or per capita income have a key role on performance.

This is a SQL Project we will primarily use SQL for this project. However we will use the output as csv from the queries to generate supporting visuals in Power BI when required.

<h2>Tools Used</h2>

PostGreSQL, PowerBI
